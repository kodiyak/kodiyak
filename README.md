## hey, i'm kodiyak 🐾

I'm a developer building things I wish existed — with a strong bias for clean UX, open source, and thoughtful tooling.

Currently working on:
- **[shadcn.cloud](https://github.com/kodiyak/shadcn.cloud)** — dynamic documentation for component libraries, powered by MDX, React Refresh, and a modpack-style architecture.
- **[lofi.surf](https://github.com/kodiyak/lofi.surf)** — a lo-fi streaming app built for focus, dark mode, and good vibes. Fully generated by AI.
- **[modpack](https://github.com/kodiyak/modpack)** — a browser-first resolver layer over `es-module-shims`, enabling complex module ecosystems with zero build.

I write TypeScript fluently, care deeply about DX, and believe great tools don’t get in your way — they get you in the zone.

> Minimal. Modular. Maintainable.
